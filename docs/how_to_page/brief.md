# Briefing

Essentially, you will likely be floating or looking after a section. Each role entail different responsibilities. The following pages will expand more on that. 
But first, some prerequisites.
 
## 1. Preparing for Your Shift

#### Dress Code
- There is no explicit dress code but wear something that looks professional.

### 1.1. Pre-Shift Briefing

- Come in 5-10 minutes early, have a cup of coffee, get to know what's happening. 'Doesn't hurt'.

## 2. Knowing the menu

  Menu Front Page

This is the front page of the menu. Usually how it works is: the food is on the left side, pricing on the right.

- Starts with oyster, two options: natural or pickled.
- Including the Snapper, everything from it down are the mains, above it are the entrees. The bottom two are sides, usually goes with the mains.
- Most of the items on the menu are designed to share.
- Desserts are on the back of the a la carte menu. To give after clearing the mains.

### 2.1. Food portioning
A single dish is generally portioned enough to share among 4 people. Consult with Chefs for more infromation and keeping up with the menu.

- The recommended number of dishes for sharing food are: <br>
4 for 2 people. <br>
2x-1 for 'group of people <= 4', so 5 dishes for 3 people and 7 things for 4 people.
<br>
- Multiples of 5 is a bit tricky. It is more of the same number (2x-1) but some dishes are recommended to be double to be enough to share for 5.
- For group > 5 < 9, the recommended number is 2* times recommended number for 'group of people <= 4'.
- For group > 11 < 14, the recommended number is 3* times recommended number for 'group of people <= 4'  

!!! note
        For larger groups, set menus are prefered, potentially the $75 per head suprise set.

There are various types of set menus.
> $75 per head surprise set menu. Easy for table with dietary complications. 
>
> $110 per head set menu. Printed, more tailored towards the number of people. Can be changed to adjust customer needs with consulting with the chefs.
>
> $165 matching wine. Same food as the $110 set with matching wine in each course. See the matching wine list on the Menu section of the Bar.
>
> $85/90 per head surprise set menu with desserts.



## 3. Greeting and Seating Guests

### 3.1. Initial Greeting
